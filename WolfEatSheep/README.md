## What is this
A game that was often played by the elderly and children in the village during my childhood. It was also one of the entertainment activities during my primary and middle school breaks. Recently, I found that I had almost forgotten the rules of these games, so I created this small game to preserve them. 

## How to
Rules are blow: 
1. Sheep can move one step once; </p>
2. Wolf can move one or two steps once. When the distance of wolf and sheep is 2, the sheep can be ate by wolf. Otherwise, wolf can move only one step once. 
3. When both two wolf can not move, sheep win. 
4. When there's no sheep left, wolf win.  

Enjoy!
